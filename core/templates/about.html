          When the people from Grupy-RN was making a regional edition of the RuPy, in 2014, we were tired of using Google forms or Call4Paperz to manage that, so  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/luanfonceca">Luan Fonseca</a> took some time and build an MVP version to make the RuPy call for papers happen in the Speakerfight.
